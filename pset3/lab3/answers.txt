sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Reversed list takes longer to sort, since we have to bubble each element to the end. When the list is sorted there are no swaps and therfore it's faster. O(n**) x Ω(n)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: The fastest and consistent out of all three sort methods => O(n log n) x Ω(n log n). Performed very well on reversed list and lists with big amount of elements compared to other sort methods. The type of the list doesnt affect it's speed much.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Not the fastest and sorting any list of the same amount of elements takes the similar amount of time => O(n**) x Ω(n**)
